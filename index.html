        <p><span id="big-letter">W</span>hen I read "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he
            never fell
            in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a
            cage,’” it reminded me how complicated love and freedom can be. It shows the tension between admiring
            strength in women, but fearing what that strength means when it cannot be controlled. Sadly, even today,
            many relationships carry this hidden expectation: love the strong spirit, but break her wings later.
            This quote resonates deeply with my own life. Growing up, my mother was a free soul — hardworking,
            independent, and proud. My father supported her freedom, but society did not. Women around her often
            criticized my father for “allowing” her to work, asking, “Why doesn’t she just sit at home? He earns
            enough.” But my mother would smile and say, “I am not his obligation; I am his partner. His children are our
            shared duty. My worth is not measured by how still I sit.” She didn’t just live these words — she taught
            them. She trained women in our community to use their skills, to find ways to earn and stand tall.
            This experience taught me that true love does not seek to cage freedom; it protects it. Gender roles and
            relationship expectations still try to shrink women into smaller lives. But strength, love, and independence
            are not enemies. They can, and should, live side by side. My mother’s life, like Trevor Noah’s mother’s,
            reminds me that a free woman is not something to fear or control — she is something to stand with, to
            cherish, and to celebrate.
            Real love builds wings, not cages.

        <h2>About the Blog</h2>
        <p>I would rename Born a Crime to The Woman Who Could Not Be Caged.
            I chose this title because Trevor Noah’s mother, Patricia, is the true center of his story. Her courage,
            faith, and refusal to be controlled shaped Trevor’s life and spirit.
            Despite violence, poverty, and the heavy expectations of society, she stayed true to herself and taught her
            son to do the same.
            Her strength in the face of impossible odds is the real reason he survived and succeeded. This title honors
            her unbreakable spirit,
            which shines through every page of the book.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>This blog is also a tribute to my own mother, who taught me that freedom and love must walk together.
            Growing up, I witnessed her strength and independence, values she instilled in me every day.
            Despite the challenges she faced, she always stood tall and remained true to herself. She showed me that
            love isn't about control,
            but about support and growth. Her legacy continues to shape the way I view the world, teaching me that being
            free—whether in love, life, or work—is the greatest gift we can give ourselves.
            Like Patricia Noah, my mother proved that true freedom doesn't come at the expense of love; it enriches it.
            Her example has inspired me to live authentically, chase my dreams, and honor those who came before me, just
            as I hope this blog does for others.</p>
